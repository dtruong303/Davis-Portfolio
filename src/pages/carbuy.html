            <p>The user will be apart of a moderated usability study. They 
              will be prompted to complete 3 tasks that can be done through the app, share any ideas, and provide any feedback. </p>

                 <p>The process to buy and sell is too long. Users want a feature that will easily populate information.</p>
                 <p>Participants found that the “Match Me” feature is not necessary and acts as a filter feature.</p>

                 <p>Users wanted an indication and tracking of the buying process.</p>
                 <p>Users wanted to be able to save their progress in the car buying process for later.</p>

            <h4>Mockups</h4>

            <p>I wanted to include a unique feature that helped users find vehicles that matched the user with their dream car. After usability studies, I found that this feature would not be necessary and that it took up too much space. I removed this feature and made the filter feature functional.</p>
            <img src="../images/wireframes/cbhifimock.png" alt="Carbuy Mockup">

            <p>The second usability study revealed frustration when going through the car buying process. Users wanted a way to be able to upload information to avoid filling out forms manually. I added an option to upload a driver’s license that would help auto populate information.</p>
